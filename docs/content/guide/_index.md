- **`unifly <command>`**: CLI for scripting, automation, and quick lookups
- **`unifly tui`**: real-time terminal dashboard for monitoring

Both are powered by a shared async engine that speaks every UniFi API dialect, so you never have to think about which endpoint to hit.

## The Problem

UniFi controllers expose two completely different APIs:

{% mermaid() %}
graph LR
subgraph "Integration API"
I["REST + API Key"]
I1["Networks, WiFi, Firewall"]
I2["DNS, ACL, NAT, Traffic Lists"]
end

    subgraph "Session API"
        S["Cookie + CSRF"]
        S1["Events, Stats, DPI"]
        S2["Device Commands, Admin"]
    end

    subgraph unifly
        U["Unified Interface"]
    end

    I --> U
    S --> U
    U --> CLI["CLI Output"]
    U --> TUI["TUI Dashboard"]

{% end %}

- **Integration API**: RESTful, API-key authenticated, covers CRUD for most resources
- **Session API**: Session-based with cookie/CSRF, required for events, statistics, and device commands

Most tools only speak one dialect. The web dashboard is slow and can't be scripted. Unifly handles the routing, authentication, and data merging automatically.

| **WiFi Management**       | Create and modify SSIDs, scan neighbors, analyze channels, track client roams and WiFi experience |
| **Firewall**              | Manage policies, zones, and ACL rules                                                             |
| **NAT**                   | Masquerade, source NAT, and destination NAT rules (via Legacy v2 API)                             |
| **Events & Alarms**       | Stream live events, acknowledge and archive alarms                                                |
| **Statistics**            | Query bandwidth, client counts, and DPI data over time                                            |
| **Raw API Access**        | Hit any controller endpoint directly with `unifly api`                                            |
| **Real-Time Dashboard**   | Monitor everything with live Braille charts and status bars                                       |

## Architecture at a Glance

{% mermaid() %}

UNIFLY["unifly<br/><i>CLI + TUI (single binary)</i>"]
API["unifly-api<br/><i>Library crate on crates.io</i>"]

    UNIFLY --> API

    API --> INT["Integration Client<br/>REST + API Key"]
    API --> SES["Session Client<br/>Cookie + CSRF"]

    API --> DS["DataStore<br/>DashMap + watch channels"]

{% end %}

Two crates with a clean dependency chain. The library is published independently for Rust developers building custom integrations. See the [Architecture](/architecture/) section for the full picture.
