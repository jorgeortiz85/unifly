The `unifly tui` subcommand launches a real-time terminal dashboard for monitoring your UniFi network. Eleven screens cover everything from live bandwidth charts to WiFi observability.

## Launch

```bash
unifly tui                   # Launch with default profile
unifly tui -p office         # Use a specific profile
unifly tui -k                # Accept self-signed TLS certs
unifly tui -v                # Verbose logging to temp directory
```

## Screens

Navigate with number keys `1`-`9`, `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`, or `,` for Settings:

## Detail Views

Press `Enter` on any list item to open a detail panel with comprehensive information:

- **Devices**: 5-tab panel (Overview, Performance, Radios, Clients, Ports)
- **Clients**: Connection details, traffic history, DHCP info
- **WiFi**: AP health decomposition, per-client WiFi metrics, channel occupancy, roam history
- **Networks**: Full VLAN config with DHCP ranges and IPv6 settings
- **Firewall**: Policy details with traffic filter breakdown

Navigate detail tabs with `h`/`l`. Press `Esc` to close.

## Data Refresh

{% mermaid() %}
graph LR
    API["Integration + Session APIs"] -->|"Every 10s"| DS["DataStore"]
    WS["WebSocket"] -->|"Real-time push"| DS
    DS -->|"watch channels"| TUI["TUI Screens"]

    style WS fill:#50fa7b,color:#0a0a0f
    style DS fill:#80ffea,color:#0a0a0f
{% end %}

- **Devices and clients**: polled every 10 seconds from both APIs
- **Health and system info**: polled every 10 seconds
- **Events**: pushed via WebSocket in real-time (no polling delay)
- **Bandwidth**: sampled from device stats on each refresh cycle

## Authentication Modes

The TUI works with all authentication modes, but some screens degrade gracefully:

| Mode              | Dashboard | Devices  | Clients  | Events   | Stats    | WiFi     |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| API Key           | Partial   | Full     | Full     | No       | No       | Full     |
| Username/Password | Full      | Full     | Full     | Full     | Full     | Full     |
| **Hybrid**        | **Full**  | **Full** | **Full** | **Full** | **Full** | **Full** |

{% tip() %}
**API Key mode** works for most TUI screens on UniFi OS. Use **Hybrid mode** only when you need live WebSocket event streaming (the Events screen). Statistics and device data are available via Session HTTP endpoints that API Key mode can reach.
{% end %}

## Graceful Degradation

When data is unavailable (e.g., API-key-only mode without Session access), panels show placeholder lines instead of crashing. The dashboard adapts to whatever data sources are available. Missing data is indicated with dim placeholder text.

## Theme

The TUI uses the [Opaline](https://crates.io/crates/opaline) theme engine with the SilkCircuit color palette. Press `,` to open Settings and use the theme selector to preview and switch themes. Theme changes take effect immediately and persist to `defaults.theme` in your config file. You can also set the initial theme via the `UNIFLY_THEME` environment variable at launch.

{% warning(title="Known Limitation") %}
Controller reconnect after a network interruption is currently broken. If the connection drops, restart the TUI to reconnect.
